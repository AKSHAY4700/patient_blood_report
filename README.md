In a pathology lab test, there is n number of samples for testing the health condition of a patient, each slide has 5 components, Sugar level, Blood pressure, Heartbeat rate, weight, fat percentage, based on input as provided by the patient's blood report.
A. Create a sample input for a healthy patient and also take random samples from a patient like

"Sugar level":75, "Blood pressure":110, "Heartbeat rate":71, "weight":65, "fat percentage":10

B. Compare inputs with healthy patient data. If the patient data is not matching with the healthy patientâ€™s data, provide a warning.

C. Provide difference in readings to the patient.

SAMPLE INPUT:

Sugar level100
Blood pressure90
Heartbeat rate71
weight92
fat percentage12
SAMPLE OUTPUT:

{'Sugar level': 100, 'Blood pressure': 90, 'Heartbeat rate': 71, 'weight': 92, 'fat percentage': 12}
Sugar level is 25 greater than ideal value
Blood pressure is 20 less than ideal value
Heartbeat rate ideal value
weight is 27 greater than ideal value
fat percentage is 2 greater than ideal value
